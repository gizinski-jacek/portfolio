						Hello! My name is Jacek Gizi≈Ñski, I am a self-taught full-stack web
						developer specializing in JavaScript seeking to pursue my newfound
						passion and start a new career in tech. Starting from no coding
						knowledge in February of 2021 I became immersed in the world of
						programming. Reading through resources such as The Odin Project and
						freecodecamp I was able to obtain fundamental skills and knowledge
						of web developement. I am constantly seeking opportunities to learn
						new concepts, technologies, and tools to become better full-stack
						developer.
